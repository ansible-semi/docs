Ansible Semi
############

Semi is a community-driven fork of `Ansible Semaphore <https://github.com/ansible-semaphore/semaphore>`_.

Why?
====

The original project has (currently) only one maintainer. That is not sustainable.

It's a good tool that can be useful to many people.

It would be a shame to let it die off.

How to become a maintainer?
===========================

1. You should at least contribute a few times to the project

2. Have some experience in Golang (backend) or JavaScript (frontend)

3. Tell us you want to be one: contact@ansibleguy.net
